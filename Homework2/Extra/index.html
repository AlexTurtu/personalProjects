            The beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance to
            the much larger foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily for
            hunting hare (beagling). Possessing a great sense of smell and
            superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as
            a detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs
            in quarantine around the world.</p>
            <p>
             The beagle is intelligent. It is a
            popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited
            health problems. The modern breed was developed in Great Britain
            around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound,
            the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the
            Harrier. Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since
            Elizabethan times in literature and paintings, and more recently in
            film, television, and comic books.</p>
